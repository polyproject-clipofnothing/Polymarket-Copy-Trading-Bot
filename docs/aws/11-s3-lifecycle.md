# S3 Lifecycle Policy — Artifacts Bucket (Dev)

## Purpose
Control storage costs by automatically expiring old artifact data
generated by simulations, recorders, and analytics.

## Scope
Bucket:
- polymarket-copy-bot-objects-dev-137097287791

Prefix:
- polymarket-copy-bot/

Only objects under this prefix are affected.

## Lifecycle Rules (Dev Defaults)

| Rule | Value |
|-----|------|
| Object expiration | 30 days |
| Noncurrent version expiration | 30 days |
| Abort multipart uploads | 7 days |

## Rationale
- Artifact data is reproducible
- Dev environments should be cost-capped
- Prevents long-term accumulation of unused objects

## Safety Notes
- No production data affected
- No immediate deletion
- Lifecycle applies only to matching prefix

## Future Improvements
- Parameterize retention by environment
- Separate rules for metrics vs artifacts
- Optional transitions to IA for longer-lived data
